# 📰 Fake News Detector 🔍

This project is a **Fake News Detection System** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to classify news headlines or articles as real or fake. It's a practical application of text classification, useful for identifying misinformation on digital platforms.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Text Cleaning:** Preprocess the input news text  
2. **Vectorization:** Convert words into numerical features using TF-IDF  
3. **Prediction:** ML model classifies the news as *Real* or *Fake*  
4. **UI:** User inputs text via a Streamlit frontend
